## What is HackDroid?

Hackdroid is a collection of pentesting and security related apps for android. The applications are divided into different categories so you can easily download any application from any category and use them for penetration testing and ethical hacking.

- Android Apps: 250+ apps in 20+ categories like wifi, hid, MITM, sniffing, etc.
- OS / Platform: hacking operating system (ROM) and platforms for android.
- Blog: useful articles related to hacking with android.

## Some important things that you should take care of before starting :

- Most applications will require root permissions so you can install Magisk to root your device or you can also search on Google or XDA Forum for how you can root your device.

- Never use your primary device for hacking because it is possible that, the creators of the application or those who modified it have already put malware on it to steal your private data. so you will think that with the help of this application you will hack something, but instead of that, you are being hacked.

- Most apps will be outdated but I try my best to provide the latest version of the application asap.

- I don't have copyright for any application. the copyright of all applications supports their owners.

- Don't do anything stupid or illegal. I'm sharing all this information keeping in mind the purpose of penetration testing and ethical hacking, not illegal hacking activity so please don't misuse.
